/**
 An object that adopts the `MMSpreadsheetViewDataSource` protocol is responsible for providing the data and views required by a spreadsheet view. A data source object represents your app’s data model and vends information to the spreadsheet view as needed. It also handles the creation and configuration of cells used by the spreadsheet view to display your data.
 
 All data source objects must implement the `numberOfRowsInSpreadsheetView:`, `numberOfColumnsInSpreadsheetView:` and `spreadsheetView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:` methods. These methods are responsible for returning the number of items in the spreadsheet view along with the items themselves. In addition, the data source should implement the `spreadsheetView:sizeForItemAtIndexPath:` method for determining cell sizes in the individual collection views.

 When configuring the spreadsheet view object, assign your data source to its dataSource property. For more information about how a spreadsheet view works with its data source to present content, see `MMSpreadsheetView` Class Reference.

/**
 `MMSpreadsheetView` is a configurable spreadsheet-like view. You choose to configure the view with zero or more header rows and zero or more header columns. Depending on this configuration, up to four collection views will be coordinated to provide the user interface. 
 

 When adding a spreadsheet view to your user interface, your app’s main job is to manage the data associated with the view. The spreadsheet view gets its data from the data source object, which is an object that conforms to the `MMSpreadsheetViewDataSource` protocol and is provided by your app. The spreadsheet view presents items onscreen using a cell, which is an instance of the UICollectionViewCell class that your data source configures and provides.
 
 ## Creating an MMSpreadsheetView
 `MMSpreadsheetView` is similar to a `UICollectionView` or `UITableView`. To create an `MMSpreadsheetView`, you instantiate the view using initWithNumberOfHeaderRows:numberOfHeaderColumns:frame:.
 
 @discussion **Note**: Set the background color of the spreadsheet view to change the separator line color. **However**, you will also see this color when the scroll goes into a bounce.
 
 @warning An NSIndexPath category is provided so that *indexPath.mmSpreadsheetRow* represents a row and *indexPath.mmSpreadsheetColumn* represents a column.
 @warning as the number of cells shown increases, scrolling performance declines. A large grid (1000x1000) takes a long time to initialize, but if the cell sizes are large enough (150x150), scrolling performance is not affected. However, a small grid (50x50) of (20x20) cells basically doesn't scroll.
