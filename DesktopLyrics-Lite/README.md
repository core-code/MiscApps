# DesktopLyrics Lite
*v1.3.8*

## Introduction:
DesktopLyrics Lite is a free application for Mac OS X that displays the lyrics of the song currently playing in "iTunes" right on your desktop. The lyrics for the song have to be set in iTunes, DesktopLyrics does nothing to fetch lyrics if they aren't available in iTunes. If you don't want to type-in all your lyrics manually you can use applications like "[iFetchLyrics][1]", "[Get Lyrical][2]" or "[SongGenie][3]".

## Requirements:
• Mac OS X 10.6 or later

## DesktopLyrics 2:
DesktopLyrics version 1.x has been discontinued, and is completely unsupported.
Please [upgrade][4] to the substantially improved version 2 for support and many improvements. It is still free!

## License &amp; Cost:
DesktopLyrics is completely free of charge and the source code is licensed under the [Open Source "MIT License"][5].

## Warning
DesktopLyrics Lite has been discontinued since 2012 and is completely unsupported. 
Consider upgrading to the much-improved version 2.0 for many new features and support.

## Download Binary:

## Usage:
1.) Place the DesktopLyrics folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) Double-click DesktopLyrics.
3.) The Preferences panel will be opened because this is the first time you use DesktopLyrics. If not, click on the DesktopLyrics menu in the Dock and select the "Preferences…" menu-item.
4.) Choose the Preferences to your liking. This is most easily done while iTunes plays an track with the lyrics set, so you can observe your changes in real-time on your desktop.
5.) Close the Preferences panel and enjoy the lyrics on your desktop.

Please note, music normally doesn't contain textual lyrics information, even when bought in online music stores. You either have to enter the lyrics manually for every track or use an application to automate the process (suggestions in the "Introduction"). Please consult the FAQ for information how to manually add lyrics.
