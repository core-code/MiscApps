# MovieDB
*v1.0beta3*
 

**Introduction:**

MovieDB is a free application for Mac OS X that lets you easily manage
your digital movie collection. By focusing exclusively on digital movies
they can be added comfortably by using drag&drop. Information about the
file is automatically extracted, information about the movie is
automatically fetched over the internet. MovieDB supports DVDs, (S)VCDs
and nearly all common video files like AVIs or MOVs. MovieDB can easily
search for your movies or sort and filter them.  

**WARNING:**

MovieDB is beta-quality and only provided as a technology-preview for
advanced users.
MovieDB is completely unsupported and is not currently under any active
development.
MovieDB's source code has [moved to
GitHub](https://github.com/core-code/MiscApps/tree/master/MovieDB) hoping that others will
help finish the app.

[www.imdb.com](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), the
website from *IMDb.com, Inc*..
